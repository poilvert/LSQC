Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of the "Large Scale Quantum Conductance" package.

The package is organised as follows :

 * a **doc/** directory where all  the documentation related to the package is
   gathered.
 * a **programs/** directory containing the Python source code for all the main
   programs.
 * a **utilities/** directory containing the Python utility modules needed  by the main
   programs.

A typical use for any of the main programs is :

::

  [prompt] python my_program.py [options]

One can always call the help menu by typing either :

::

  [prompt] python my_program.py --help (or -h)

or simply :

::

  [prompt] python my_program.py

.. Note::
  when  using  this package, please  keep  the  structure  intact  ( i.e. keep
  the  tree structure  of the  main directory unchanged)  as the main programs
  expect to find the modules in a directory ("utilities") which is at the same
  point in the tree structure as the "programs" directory.
